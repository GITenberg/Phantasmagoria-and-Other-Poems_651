1</span>PHANTASMAGORIA</h2>
<h3>CANTO I<br />
The Trystyng</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">One</span> winter night, at
half-past nine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cold, tired, and cross, and
muddy,<br />
I had come home, too late to dine,<br />
And supper, with cigars and wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was waiting in the study.</p>
<p class="poetry">There was a strangeness in the room,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Something white and wavy<br />
Was standing near me in the gloom&mdash;<br />
<i>I</i> took it for the carpet-broom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left by that careless slavey.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>But presently the Thing began<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To shiver and to sneeze:<br />
On which I said &ldquo;Come, come, my man!<br />
That&rsquo;s a most inconsiderate plan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less noise there, if you
please!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught a cold,&rdquo; the Thing
replies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Out there upon the
landing.&rdquo;<br />
I turned to look in some surprise,<br />
And there, before my very eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little Ghost was standing!</p>
<p class="poetry">He trembled when he caught my eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And got behind a chair.<br />
&ldquo;How came you here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and why?<br />
I never saw a thing so shy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come out!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t shiver
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He said &ldquo;I&rsquo;d gladly tell you
how,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And also tell you why;<br />
But&rdquo; (here he gave a little bow)<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in so bad a temper now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think it all a
lie.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And as to being in a fright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to remark<br />
That Ghosts have just as good a right<br />
In every way, to fear the light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Men to fear the
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;No plea,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;can well excuse<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such cowardice in you:<br />
For Ghosts can visit when they choose,<br />
Whereas we Humans ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t refuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To grant the interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He said &ldquo;A flutter of alarm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not unnatural, is it?<br />
I really feared you meant some harm:<br />
But, now I see that you are calm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain my visit.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Houses are classed, I beg to state,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the number<br />
Of Ghosts that they accommodate:<br />
(The Tenant merely counts as <i>weight</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Coals and other lumber).</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;This is a &lsquo;one-ghost&rsquo; house,
and you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you arrived last summer,<br
/>
May have remarked a Spectre who<br />
Was doing all that Ghosts can do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To welcome the new-comer.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>&ldquo;In Villas this is always done&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However cheaply rented:<br />
For, though of course there&rsquo;s less of fun<br />
When there is only room for one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghosts have to be contented.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;That Spectre left you on the
Third&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then you&rsquo;ve not been
haunted:<br />
For, as he never sent us word,<br />
&rsquo;Twas quite by accident we heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That any one was wanted.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;A Spectre has first choice, by right,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In filling up a vacancy;<br />
Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite&mdash;<br />
If all these fail them, they invite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nicest Ghoul that they can
see.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The Spectres said the place was low,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that you kept bad wine:<br />
So, as a Phantom had to go,<br />
And I was first, of course, you know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t well
decline.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they settled
who<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was fittest to be sent<br />
Yet still to choose a brat like you,<br />
To haunt a man of forty-two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was no great
compliment!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so young, Sir,&rdquo; he
replied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;As you might think.&nbsp;
The fact is,<br />
In caverns by the water-side,<br />
And other places that I&rsquo;ve tried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a lot of
practice:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But I have never taken yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strict domestic part,<br />
And in my flurry I forget<br />
The Five Good Rules of Etiquette<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to know by
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">My sympathies were warming fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards the little fellow:<br />
He was so utterly aghast<br />
At having found a Man at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And looked so scared and
yellow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page7"></a><span

<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to
find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Ghost is not a <i>dumb</i>
thing!<br />
But pray sit down: you&rsquo;ll feel inclined<br />
(If, like myself, you have not dined)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take a snack of something:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Though, certainly, you don&rsquo;t
appear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thing to offer <i>food</i>
to!<br />
And then I shall be glad to hear&mdash;<br />
If you will say them loud and clear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rules that you allude
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Thanks!&nbsp; You shall hear them by and
by.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This <i>is</i> a piece of
luck!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What may I offer you?&rdquo; said I.<br />
&ldquo;Well, since you <i>are</i> so kind, I&rsquo;ll try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little bit of duck.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<i>One</i> slice!&nbsp; And may I ask
you for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another drop of gravy?&rdquo;<br
/>
I sat and looked at him in awe,<br />
For certainly I never saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thing so white and wavy.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>And still he seemed to grow more white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More vapoury, and wavier&mdash;<br
/>
Seen in the dim and flickering light,<br />
As he proceeded to recite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His &ldquo;Maxims of
Behaviour.&rdquo;</p>

Don&rsquo;t touch the curtains at his head,<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And wave them slowly in and out,<br />

And in a minute&rsquo;s time, no doubt,<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And here you must on no pretence<br />

In such a case your course is clear&mdash;<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;By day, if he should be alone&mdash;<br

66</span>HIAWATHA&rsquo;S PHOTOGRAPHING</h2>
<p>[In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this
slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy.&nbsp; Any
fairly practised writer, with the slightest ear for rhythm, could
compose, for hours together, in the easy running metre of
&lsquo;The Song of Hiawatha.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having, then,
distinctly stated that I challenge no attention in the following
little poem to its merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid
reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the
subject.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">From</span> his shoulder
Hiawatha<br />
Took the camera of rosewood,<br />
Made of sliding, folding rosewood;<br />
Neatly put it all together.<br />
In its case it lay compactly,<br />
Folded into nearly nothing;<br />
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>But he
opened out the hinges,<br />
Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,<br />
Till it looked all squares and oblongs,<br />
Like a complicated figure<br />
In the Second Book of Euclid.</p>

Crouched beneath its dusky cover&mdash;<br />
Stretched his hand, enforcing silence&mdash;<br />

Mystic, awful was the process.<br />

Sat before him for their pictures:<br />
Each in turn, as he was taken,<br />
Volunteered his own suggestions,<br />
His ingenious suggestions.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; First the Governor, the Father:<br />
He suggested velvet curtains<br />
Looped about a massy pillar;<br />
And the corner of a table,<br />
Of a rosewood dining-table.<br />
He would hold a scroll of something,<br />
Hold it firmly in his left-hand;<br />
He would keep his right-hand buried<br />
(Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;<br />
He would contemplate the distance<br />
With a look of pensive meaning,<br />
As of ducks that die ill tempests.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grand, heroic was the notion:<br />
Yet the picture failed entirely:<br />
Failed, because he moved a little,<br />
Moved, because he couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>

She came dressed beyond description,<br />
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Dressed in
jewels and in satin<br />
Far too gorgeous for an empress.<br />
Gracefully she sat down sideways,<br />
With a simper scarcely human,<br />
Holding in her hand a bouquet<br />
Rather larger than a cabbage.<br />
All the while that she was sitting,<br />
Still the lady chattered, chattered,<br />
Like a monkey in the forest.<br />
&ldquo;Am I sitting still?&rdquo; she asked him.<br />
&ldquo;Is my face enough in profile?<br />
Shall I hold the bouquet higher?<br />
Will it came into the picture?&rdquo;<br />
And the picture failed completely.</p>

He suggested curves of beauty,<br />
Curves pervading all his figure,<br />

Centered in the golden breast-pin.<br />
He had learnt it all from Ruskin<br />

daughter:<br />
She suggested very little,<br />
Only asked if he would take her<br />
With her look of &lsquo;passive beauty.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her idea of passive beauty<br />
Was a squinting of the left-eye,<br />
Was a drooping of the right-eye,<br />
Was a smile that went up sideways<br />
To the corner of the nostrils.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiawatha, when she asked him,<br />
Took no notice of the question,<br />
Looked as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard it;<br />
But, when pointedly appealed to,<br />
Smiled in his peculiar manner,<br />
Coughed and said it &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo;<br />
Bit his lip and changed the subject.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor in this was he mistaken,<br />

taken:<br />
Very rough and thick his hair was,<br />
Very round and red his face was,<br />
Very dusty was his jacket,<br />
Very fidgety his manner.<br />
And his overbearing sisters<br />
Called him names he disapproved of:<br />
Called him Johnny, &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;s Darling,&rsquo;<br />
Called him Jacky, &lsquo;Scrubby School-boy.&rsquo;<br />
And, so awful was the picture,<br />
In comparison the others<br />
Seemed, to one&rsquo;s bewildered fancy,<br />
To have partially succeeded.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally my Hiawatha<br />
Tumbled all the tribe together,<br />
(&lsquo;Grouped&rsquo; is not the right expression),<br />
And, as happy chance would have it<br />
Did at last obtain a picture<br />
Where the faces all succeeded:<br />
Each came out a perfect likeness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they joined and all abused it,<br />
Unrestrainedly abused it,<br />
As the worst and ugliest picture<br />
They could possibly have dreamed of.<br />
&lsquo;Giving one such strange expressions&mdash;<br />
Sullen, stupid, pert expressions.<br />
Really any one would take us<br />
(Any one that did not know us)<br />
For the most unpleasant people!&rsquo;<br />
(Hiawatha seemed to think so,<br />
Seemed to think it not unlikely).<br />
All together rang their voices,<br />
Angry, loud, discordant voices,<br />
As of dogs that howl in concert,<br />
As of cats that wail in chorus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But my Hiawatha&rsquo;s patience,<br />
His politeness and his patience,<br />
Unaccountably had vanished,<br />
And he left that happy party.<br />
Neither did he leave them slowly,<br />
With the calm deliberation,<br />
The intense deliberation<br />
Of a photographic artist:<br />
But he left them in a hurry,<br />
Left them in a mighty hurry,<br />
Stating that he would not stand it,<br />
Stating in emphatic language<br />
What he&rsquo;d be before he&rsquo;d stand it.<br />

he packed his boxes:<br />
Hurriedly the porter trundled<br />

<p>[Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that
process of Dilution which has proved so advantageous to her
sister-art Music?&nbsp; The Diluter gives us first a few notes of
some well-known Air, then a dozen bars of his own, then a few
more notes of the Air, and so on alternately: thus saving the
listener, if not from all risk of recognising the melody at all,
at least from the too-exciting transports which it might produce
in a more concentrated form.&nbsp; The process is termed
&ldquo;setting&rdquo; by Composers, and any one, that has ever
experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap
of mortar, will recognise the truthfulness of this happy
phrase.</p>
<p>For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a
morsel of supreme Venison&mdash;whose every fibre seems to murmur
&ldquo;Excelsior!&rdquo;&mdash;yet swallows, ere returning to the
toothsome dainty, great mouthfuls of oatmeal-porridge and
winkles: and just as the perfect Connoisseur in Claret permits
himself but one delicate sip, and then tosses off a pint or more
of boarding-school beer: so also&mdash;</p>

Incessant pop the corks, and busy knives<br />

tongue and chicken.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And all is tangled talk and mazy motion&mdash;<br />
Much like a waving field of golden grain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a tempestuous
ocean.</p>
<p class="poetry">And thus they give the time, that Nature
meant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For peaceful sleep and meditative snores,<br />
To ceaseless din and mindless merriment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And waste of
shoes and floors.</p>
<p class="poetry">And One (we name him not) that flies the
flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That dreads the dances, and that shuns the
salads,<br />
They doom to pass in solitude the hours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing
acrostic-ballads.</p>

<p class="poetry">The Uncle gravely nods, and wisely winks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It <i>may</i> mean much, but how is one to know?<br

He opens his mouth&mdash;yet out of it, methinks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No words of

<p class="poetry">But all is lost: that mighty mind
o&rsquo;erthrown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like sweet bells jangled, piteous sight to see!<br

&ldquo;Doubt that the stars are fire,&rdquo; so runs his moan,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubt Truth herself, but not my love for

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
